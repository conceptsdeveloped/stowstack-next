/**
 * Detection — turn PMS snapshots into domain events (MISSION.md s7).
 *
 * The only historical source this product has is `facility_pms_rent_roll`,
 * which carries a `snapshot_date` per upload. Comparing the two most recent
 * snapshots for a facility yields move-ins, move-outs, rate changes and the
 * delinquency ladder.
 *
 * `inventory.available` needs a second source. `facility_pms_units` is upserted
 * CURRENT state, so `captureUnitMix` copies it into `facility_pms_unit_history`
 * whenever the source data has moved, and the last two captures are diffed.
