/**
 * Who listens to what (MISSION.md s7).
 *
 * One event fans out to every queue named here. Adding a subscriber is one line
 * plus a handler in `src/lib/jobs/handlers.ts`; nothing else in the system needs
 * to know it exists, which is the whole point of the bus.
 *
 * The queues below are the Modules v2 capabilities that were waiting on an X to
 * their "when X happens, do Y". They are listed — deliberately — before their
 * handlers exist: an unregistered queue FREEZES rather than fails (see the
 * runner), so the events accumulate visibly and are re-deliverable the day the
 * handler ships, instead of being silently dropped between now and then.
 *
 * Registered handlers today: none of these. That is intentional and is why the
 * map is the documentation.
