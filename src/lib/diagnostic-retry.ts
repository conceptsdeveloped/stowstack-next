 * hourly cron, `/api/cron/retry-diagnostic-audits`, which woke the database
 * 24 times a day to find, almost always, nothing.
 *
 * Now the intake queues one check for the moment its facility would count as
 * stuck (`scheduleDiagnosticRetry`). If generation already happened, the check
 * finds nothing. If it did not, the check retries, and a failed retry is
 * retried by the queue with backoff. A six-hourly sweep catches anything older
 * that slipped past, at the hourly cron's old pace of five per run.
