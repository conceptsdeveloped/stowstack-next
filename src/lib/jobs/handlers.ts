/**
 * Handler registry (MISSION.md s1).
 *
 * A queue name maps to exactly one handler. Anything claimed for a queue with
 * no handler is frozen rather than failed — an unregistered queue is a deploy
 * problem, and freezing keeps the work resumable once the handler ships.
 *
 * To add a queue: write the handler, register it here, and enqueue with that
 * name. A handler MUST:
 *   - be safe to run twice (the worker can die after the work and before the
 *     write, and the job will come back);
 *   - check `ctx.shouldYield()` between units and return `{ kind: "more" }`
 *     with a cursor rather than pushing through — that is the whole point;
 *   - throw `OutcomeUnknown` when it cannot tell whether an external side
 *     effect happened. Never guess, and never retry an unknown.
