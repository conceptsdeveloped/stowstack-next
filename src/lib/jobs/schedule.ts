/**
 * Recurring work (MISSION.md s1).
 *
 * The handlers and the worker existed but nothing created the jobs, so the
 * detection loop would have sat inert. This is the missing half: recurring work
 * as data, seeded by the worker itself at the top of every run.
 *
 * One Vercel cron entry drives everything. Adding a recurring job is a line
 * here, not another entry in `vercel.json` — which matters because there are
 * already 23 of those and each one is a separate function, a separate cold
 * start and a separate thing to notice has stopped.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: the dedupe key carries the time bucket, so
 * seeding twice inside one interval is a no-op and a worker that runs every
 * minute cannot pile up duplicates.
