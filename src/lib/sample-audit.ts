        "Midway Self Storage & U-Haul has a strong physical asset and a defensible local moat, but the marketing and revenue-management muscle isn't built, and it's costing roughly $2,576/month in vacancy plus another $1,000+/month in unrealized rate and insurance revenue. Lead generation is effectively unfunded, follow-up systems don't exist, and the Google review gap to Kalamazoo competitors is widening every month. Every issue is fixable in 90 days with a structured plan; doing nothing means dropping from 79% to 73% occupancy by Q4 while two newly permitted competitors prepare to come online within 18 months.",
