/**
 * Tour booking, reminders and no-show recovery (MISSION.md RESPOND r6/r7).
 *
 * `lead_status` already carried a 'toured' value and the schema anticipated
 * `tour_booked`, but nothing ever booked one — so this is the missing table plus
 * the three messages that make a booked tour actually happen.
 *
 * ## Why the reminders are swept, not pre-scheduled
 *
 * The obvious design is to enqueue two jobs at booking time with a future
 * `run_after`. It is wrong here: the moment somebody reschedules, those jobs are
 * still pointing at the old time, and cancelling them means tracking job ids on
 * the tour row. Sweeping instead means the tour row is the only truth about when
 * the tour is, and `message_log` is the only truth about what we have sent — no
 * third copy of either fact to drift.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT here
 *
 * Slot availability. Zero facilities in the database have `hours` populated, so
 * generating bookable slots from them would be fiction. A requested time is
 * validated for sanity (future, not absurdly far out, inside a plausible
 * daytime hour in the facility's own zone) and otherwise trusted. When real
 * office hours exist, `withinBookableHours` is the one place to tighten.
