/**
 * Abandoned-rental rescue by text (MISSION.md RESPOND r8).
 *
 * ⚠️ There is already a recovery system: `/api/cron/process-recovery` is 361
 * lines of multi-step EMAIL recovery driven by `recovery_status`,
 * `recovery_sent_count` and `next_recovery_at`, and it runs daily. This does not
 * replace it and does not touch it.
 *
 * What it adds is the leg that system cannot cover: a text within minutes. Email
 * on a daily cron is the right tool for a nurture sequence and the wrong one for
 * somebody who half-filled a rental form ten minutes ago and is, right now,
 * looking at a competitor's site.
 *
 * Deliberately no new column: `message_log` already records exactly what we sent
 * and when, so `dedupeKey` is both the idempotency guard and the "have we
 * rescued this lead" answer.
