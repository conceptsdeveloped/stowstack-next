/**
 * Speed-to-lead (MISSION.md RESPOND r5).
 *
 * A storage enquiry is worth about a hundred times more in the first minute than
 * in the first hour, for the same reason a missed call is (`./missed-call`): the
 * person filling in a rental form has three other tabs open. So this runs INLINE
 * on the submit request, not on the queue — the worker ticks once a minute, and a
 * response that arrives a minute late has already lost the race it exists to win.
 * The queue is the durable fallback for a failed inline send.
 *
 * Two messages go out, and both matter:
 *
 *   - the LEAD gets an acknowledgement, so the next sixty seconds feel handled
 *     rather than silent, and so they have a thread to reply into;
 *   - the OPERATOR gets an alert with the number, because the thing that
 *     actually rents a unit is a human calling back, and they cannot call
 *     somebody they have not been told about.
 *
 * ## What counts as a lead
 *
 * Not the `partial-lead` beacon. That endpoint fires repeatedly while somebody
 * is still typing — it is how `r8` knows about abandonment — and texting from it
 * would mean texting people mid-form. The real submit paths are
 * `/api/consumer-lead` and `/api/lead-capture`, both of which set
 * `converted = true` and `lead_status = 'new'`, and both of which call in here.
