/**
 * Operator window onto the job queue (MISSION.md s1's last acceptance item).
 *
 * The queue, the worker and the schedule all shipped with no way to see them —
 * `/api/cron/jobs?stats=1` needs the cron secret, which an operator does not
 * have. "Is anything stuck?" is the question this answers.
 *
 * `frozen` is the row that matters. A frozen job is one whose outcome is
 * UNKNOWN — a vendor may or may not have acted — so it is deliberately never
 * retried automatically. It waits for a human, and this is where the human
 * finds it.
