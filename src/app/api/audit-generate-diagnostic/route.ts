===== YOUR TASK =====

Generate a JSON object with EXACTLY this structure. Score each category 0-100 based on the data above. Be brutally honest but constructive. Every flag and action must reference specific data from above — no generic advice.

IMPORTANT SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Green flags = things this facility is already doing well (based on their answers)
- Yellow flag = an area that's okay but has clear room for improvement
- Red flags = critical problems that are actively costing them money or leads
- Actions must be specific, pragmatic, and immediately actionable with clear next steps
- "doNothingConsequence" = What SPECIFICALLY happens to this facility in 6-12 months if they ignore this category. Use real numbers from their data (vacancy rate, move-out pace, revenue loss). Make it visceral and financially painful — this is what sells the engagement.
- "inactionCost" = Estimated dollar amount this category is costing them per year if nothing changes. Be specific using their unit count, vacancy, rates, etc.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Each category MUST have exactly 2 green flags, exactly 1 yellow flag, exactly 3 red flags, and 2-4 actions.
2. Each category MUST have a doNothingConsequence (2-3 sentences, specific to their data) and inactionCost (dollar amount).
3. Reference the ACTUAL data from the diagnostic — not generic self-storage advice.
4. The costOfInaction and ninetyDayProjection sections are REQUIRED. Use their actual move-in/move-out pace, unit count, and occupancy to calculate real projections. If move-outs are outpacing move-ins, project that forward. If they have no ECRI, calculate lost revenue per existing tenant.
5. Actions must be things they can DO this week or this month — not vague strategies.
6. Use operator language: "move-ins" not "customers", "units" not "rooms", "street rate" not "price".
7. The doNothingConsequence should create URGENCY — paint a clear picture of the facility's trajectory if they ignore the findings. Reference competitors by name where provided.
8. inactionCost should be a realistic annual estimate based on their data (vacancy * rate * 12, lost ECRI revenue, wasted ad spend, etc.).`;
