            Most independent operators have the same problem. Money goes out to
            ads every month, and nobody can say which of those ads actually
            filled a unit.
          </p>

          <p>
            The agency sends a tidy report. Clicks are up. Everything looks
            great. Ask how many of those clicks turned into tenants and the
            answer stops coming.
          </p>

          <p style={{ color: "var(--text-primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>
            StorageAds exists to answer that question, and then fix it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Not a general marketing tool with a storage page bolted on. Not
            something built for e-commerce and reshaped to fit. A system built
            around the way storage operators actually run the business:
            move-ins, occupancy, and revenue.
          </p>

              background: "var(--border-subtle)",
            }}
          />

          <p>
            You mark a move-in when it happens. The report shows where that
            person came from: the ad, the page, or the office.
          </p>

          <p>
            That is what you look at next. Spend that is not filling units is
            the spend you can stop. What is filling units is the spend you keep.
          </p>

          <p style={{ color: "var(--text-primary)", fontWeight: 500 }}>
            The REITs have run this way for years. Independents have not had the

          <p>
            You deserve to know where the money is going. Not
            &quot;impressions&quot; and &quot;click-through rates&quot;: real
            answers. How many move-ins did the ads bring this month? What did
            each one cost? Which campaigns stay and which ones go?
          </p>

          <p>
            Storage is the only thing we build for. Every feature has to earn
            its place against one test: does it fill units? If it
            doesn&apos;t, it doesn&apos;t ship.
          </p>

            This isn&apos;t a marketing agency. It&apos;s the marketing system
            the REITs already have, built for the operators who don&apos;t.
