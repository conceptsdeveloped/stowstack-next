        <h2>1. What Are Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website.
          They help us provide a better experience, remember your preferences, and
          understand how our services are used.

        <h2>2. Cookies We Use</h2>

        <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Required for the platform to function. These handle authentication sessions,
          security tokens, and basic functionality. Cannot be disabled.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Session cookie</strong> — maintains your login state</li>
          <li><strong>CSRF token</strong> — prevents cross-site request forgery</li>
          <li><strong>Preference cookies</strong> — stores timezone, sidebar state</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
        <p>

          No personal data is shared with third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Advertising Attribution Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          On StorageAds landing pages (storageads.com/lp/*), we use cookies to track
          the connection between ad clicks and storage unit reservations. This is the
          core of our attribution system. These cookies store:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>UTM parameters (campaign source, medium, campaign name)</li>
          <li>Platform click IDs (fbclid for Meta, gclid for Google)</li>
          <li>StorageAds session identifiers for attribution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is used exclusively to measure advertising performance and
          calculate cost-per-move-in for facility operators.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies from the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clerk</strong> — Authentication (session management)</li>
          <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — Payment processing (fraud prevention)</li>
          <li><strong>Meta Pixel</strong> — On landing pages only, for ad conversion tracking</li>

        <h2>4. Managing Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling essential cookies
          may prevent the dashboard from functioning correctly. Disabling attribution cookies
          on landing pages will prevent accurate move-in tracking.
